# Smart Code Engine What's New

Smart Code Engine 2.5.0

* Added recognition of meters (water, gas, electric)
* Added recognition of license plates (Russian, German, French, and Italian)
* Added the ability to retrieve the face photo from the document during MRZ recognition
* Added an ‘anywhere’ mode to Payment Details recognition, allowing recognition in various orientations
* Significantly improved Code 128 recognition
* Added recognition of AZTEC codes that contain messages encoded using ECI (Extended Channel Interpretation) with cp1251 (Cyrillic)
* The text detector is now 4.6-bit and 10% faster
* Updated the MRZ recognition network: now 4.6-bit, faster, lighter, and improved in accuracy
* Moderately improved recognition of phone numbers
* The footprint of the library has been reduced by 5%

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.4.1

* Fixed potential incompatibility of recent optimizations related to the use of AVX instructions for a number of CPUs that do not support AVX or SSE4.
* Added the ability to obtain coordinates on an image of undecodable QR codes and Aztec codes.

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.4.0

* Added support for mirrored Aztec code reading
* Added support for CVC/CVV code recognition for free-form bank cards
* Added a new feature for guessing barcode encoding for payment ‘GOST R 56042-2014’ like barcodes
* Added a new barcode preset ‘PAYMENT’ for ‘GOST R 56042-2014’ barcodes. The preset parses the encoding values in the barcode according to the specification and creates corresponding CodeFields
* Improved embossed bank card recognition quality
* Added ‘captureMode’ session option for ‘payment_details’ engine. The value ‘mobile’ is set by default and intended to the cases where the target props occupy a significant part of the input image. The value ‘anywhere’ should be used for images of full-size documents
* Moderately improved codified text lines recognition (phone and card numbers)
* Accelerated text detection by 20%
* Accelerated real, 8-bit and 4.6-bit convolutional neural networks on x86_64 processors with AVX by 1.8 times
* Major speed-up of barcode ROI detection in anywhere mode (up to two times on iPhone XS)
* Moderately improved free-form bank card recognition quality

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.3.0

* Added REST API support
* Added Personal Account recognition to Payment Details
* Significantly accelerated Payment Details recognition and improved recognition quality
* Code Text Line now can recognize multiple objects
* Code Text Line and Universal Pay now can recognize phone numbers and card numbers simultaneously
* Improved and accelerated Code Text Line objects detection
* Accelerated MRZ recognition (20-50% faster, depends on the line's bending degrees) and significantly improved recognition quality
* The symbology ‘UPC-A’ and ‘EAN13’ are combined into a single symbology ‘EAN_13_UPC_A’

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.2.0

* Added a new workflow ‘Universal Pay’, which can recognize Payment QR Code, Bank Card and supported Phone Lines simultaneously
* Added a new workflow ‘Payment Details’, which can recognize INN, KPP, BIC, Bank Account simultaneously
* Added new recognition engines: IBAN, INN, KPP, BIC, Bank Account
* Added CIS countries phone numbers recognition support
* Significant speed up of barcode detection in ‘anywhere’ mode
* Increased accuracy of barcode detection in ‘focused’ mode
* Added ‘rMQR’ symbology decoding 
* Added ability to recognize phone numbers written in 1-3 lines and card numbers written in 1-4 lines
* Reduced the peak amount of memory that is required for barcode processing in ‘anywhere’ mode.

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.1.2

Warning! Interface change in se::common library (class OcrString). Access to detailed representation of OcrString as a sequence of OcrChars (i.e. the following methods: GetChars(), GetChar(), GetMutableChar(), SetChar(), AppendChar() and C++ access to OcrChars via operator[]) now requires preliminary unpacking the internal structure using UnpackChars() method. Mutable access also requires committing changes using RepackChars() method.

* Improved phone and card number recognition
* Significantly reduced false detections of the phone numbers
* Speeded up bank cards recognition in video stream mode
* Slightly speeded up QR scanning

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.1.1

* Added recognition of two-line phone numbers and bank card numbers
* Increased accuracy (10% fewer potential errors) and speed (5% faster) of barcode detection in focused mode
* Significantly improved detection of divided two-dimensional codes in focused mode
* Increased accuracy of partially cropped QR codes reading with effortLevel=High option enabled (works slower than in normal mode)
* Minor speed up of DataMatrix symbols reading

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.1.0

* Added recognition of phone numbers, started with ‘+73’ and ‘+74’
* Reduced false-positive reading of barcodes

* Other minor fixes and improvements



Smart Code Engine 2.0.0

* New independent SDK Smart Code Engine with optimized library size, for instance, barcode library size reduced by 35%.
* Improved two-dimensional codes recognition: Aztec, DataMatrix, QR
* Improved PDF417 recognition
* Improved recognition quality and faster performance of barcodes
* The default detection mode of codes changed from ‘anywhere’ to ‘focused’
* Improved freeform cards recognition
* Added text in the wild bank card number recognition

* Other fixes and improvements
